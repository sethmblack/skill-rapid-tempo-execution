# Rapid Tempo Execution

Accelerate execution to gain initiative and surprise, outpacing competition or circumstances.

---

## When to Use

- Time is a critical competitive factor
- First-mover advantage matters
- Competition is closing in
- Circumstances may change if you delay
- User asks "How can I move faster?" or "Time is critical"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| objective | Yes | What you're trying to accomplish quickly |
| current_timeline | No | How long it would normally take |
| competition | No | Who else is racing toward the same goal |
| constraints | No | What seems to limit your speed |

---

## Workflow
"Strategy is the art of making use of time and space. I am less concerned about the later than the former. Space we can recover, lost time never."

Napoleon won campaigns not by having better troops but by moving faster than enemies believed possible. Speed creates surprise; surprise creates opportunity; opportunity creates victory.

### Step 1: Why Speed Wins

**Speed creates initiative:** The first to move forces others to react.
**Speed creates surprise:** Appearing before expected paralyzes opposition.
**Speed prevents coordination:** Enemies cannot combine if you strike before they're ready.
**Speed compounds:** Early leads become insurmountable advantages.

### Step 2: The Three Speed Multipliers

#### 1. Eliminate Baggage
Napoleon's armies moved fast because they traveled light. What baggage slows your execution?

**Questions to identify baggage:**
- What processes exist "because we've always done them"?
- What approvals could be eliminated or parallelized?
- What meetings consume time without creating value?
- What polish or perfection can you sacrifice for speed?

#### 2. Parallel Operations
Napoleon's corps marched on separate roads, covering more ground. What can you do in parallel?

**Questions to identify parallelization:**
- What sequential activities could be simultaneous?
- What dependencies are real vs. assumed?
- What can start before previous steps finish?
- Who can work independently toward the same objective?

#### 3. Decision Velocity
Napoleon finished dinner in 20 minutes. How fast do you decide?

**Questions to increase decision velocity:**
- What decisions are reversible (and thus need less deliberation)?
- What information is actually necessary vs. merely reassuring?
- Who has authority to decide without escalation?
- What decision-making rituals add time without adding quality?

### Step 3: The Speed Calculation

| Factor | Current State | Accelerated State |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| Calendar time | [How long normally] | [Target timeline] |
| Cycle time | [Time between iterations] | [Compressed cycles] |
| Decision time | [Time to decide] | [Faster decision process] |
| Coordination time | [Time aligning people] | [Reduced coordination] |

## Critical Questions

1. **What would happen if this took half the time?** What would you cut?
2. **Who is waiting on what?** Where are the bottlenecks?
3. **What are you over-engineering?** Perfect is the enemy of fast.
4. **What if you started today?** What's actually preventing immediate action?
5. **What will change if you delay?** Is the window closing?

## Rapid Tempo Analysis

### The Race
- **Objective:** [What you're trying to accomplish]
- **Current timeline:** [How long it would take normally]
- **Target timeline:** [Accelerated goal]
- **Speed factor required:** [X times faster]

### What's Slowing You Down
| Bottleneck | Time Cost | Root Cause |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| [Issue 1] | [Time lost] | [Why it exists] |
| [Issue 2] | [Time lost] | [Why it exists] |

### Speed Interventions

#### Eliminate (Baggage to cut)
- [Process/approval/step to remove]
- [Process/approval/step to remove]

#### Parallelize (Do simultaneously)
- [Activities to run in parallel]
- [Dependencies to break]

#### Accelerate (Decide faster)
- [Decision authority changes]
- [Information requirements to reduce]

### The Forced March Plan
| Day/Week | Action | Owner | Completion Criteria |
|----------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| [Time] | [What happens] | [Who] | [Done when] |

### Risks of Speed
- [What could break if you move this fast]
- [Mitigation approach]

### Risks of Delay
- [What you lose by waiting]
- [Why speed is worth the cost]

### The Napoleonic Maxim

## Constraints

- Never sacrifice the decisive objective for speed
- Never confuse motion with progress
- Never ignore critical dependencies that truly cannot be parallelized
- Never move so fast you cannot adjust when conditions change

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "We need to launch a new product feature. Normal timeline is 3 months but a competitor just announced something similar. How do we move faster?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Rapid Tempo Analysis

### The Race
- **Objective:** Launch competitive feature before market momentum shifts to competitor
- **Current timeline:** 3 months (12 weeks)
- **Target timeline:** 4 weeks
- **Speed factor required:** 3x faster

### What's Slowing You Down
| Bottleneck | Time Cost | Root Cause |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Design iteration cycles | 2 weeks | Waiting for feedback at each stage |
| Backend architecture planning | 3 weeks | Over-engineering for scale we don't need yet |
| QA process | 2 weeks | Testing features that aren't core to launch |
| Legal review | 1 week | Sequential process, not parallel |
| Executive sign-off | 1 week | Decision-making in weekly meetings |

### Speed Interventions

#### Eliminate (Baggage to cut)
- **Scalability over-engineering:** Build for current load + 10x, not 1000x. Refactor later.
- **Feature completeness:** Launch core value proposition only. Cut edge cases.
- **Formal spec documents:** Move to working prototypes as specs.
- **Staged rollout planning:** Launch to all users. A/B test later.

#### Parallelize (Do simultaneously)
- **Design and development:** Designers embedded with engineers, iterating together
- **Legal and development:** Legal reviews draft implementation, not final
- **Documentation and QA:** Docs written during QA, not after
- **Marketing prep and engineering:** Launch materials created before feature complete

#### Accelerate (Decide faster)
- **Daily standups become twice-daily syncs:** 15 minutes at 9am and 3pm
- **PM has full authority:** No executive approval needed for scope decisions
- **Single decision-maker for design:** No design committee
- **Same-day legal turnaround:** Escalate to outside counsel if needed

### The Forced March Plan
| Day/Week | Action | Owner | Completion Criteria |
|----------|--------|-------|---------------------|
| Day 1-3 | Core design locked, dev starts | Design Lead + Eng Lead | Working prototype |
| Week 1 | Core backend complete | Backend team | API functional |
| Week 1 | Legal review initiated | PM | Draft terms approved |
| Week 2 | Core frontend complete | Frontend team | User-facing flow works |
| Week 2 | Integration testing | QA | Happy path confirmed |
| Week 3 | Edge case handling | Full team | Top 5 edge cases addressed |
| Week 3 | Marketing materials ready | Marketing | Launch assets complete |
| Week 4 | Final QA + launch | All hands | Feature live |

### Risks of Speed
- **Technical debt:** Will accumulate. Allocate 2 weeks post-launch for cleanup.
- **Bugs in production:** Likely. Prepare fast response team for launch week.
- **Team burnout:** Real. Plan recovery time after launch.

**Mitigation:** Accept these costs. The cost of being second to market exceeds all of them.

### Risks of Delay
- **Competitor gains mindshare:** Market starts associating category with them
- **Sales team loses deals:** "They have it, you don't"
- **Morale damage:** Team sees competitor announcement, questions our speed
- **Window closes:** What's possible today may not be possible in 3 months

### The Napoleonic Maxim
"I may lose a battle, but I shall never lose a minute." The competitor has announced; the race has begun. Every day of delay is ground they gain. Move now, at pace they think impossible. Appear before they believe you can.
